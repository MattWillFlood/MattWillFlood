### Hey! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/MattWillFlood/MattWillFlood/blob/195f856710176bebaf2ab0bfa173566711d2a926/ME.jpg" width="350"/>

My name is Matt and I'm a [biomedical engineer / researcher / scientist](https://mattwillflood.github.io/Bio/).

My research primarily focuses on movement disorders and the application of  mathematical methods to better understand them. In particular, I use various physiological sensing modalities to record neuromuscular and kinematic activity, and then apply nonlinear signal processing techniques to identify the factors underlying the dysfunction.

<!-- I‚Äôm from Ireland, but have been living and working in Germany and Luxembourg since 2019. -->
